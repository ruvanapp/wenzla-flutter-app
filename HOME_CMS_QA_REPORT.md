## Observations

### ✅ All CMS API endpoints working correctly

**Banners:**
- CRUD complete (create, read, update, delete, image upload, reorder)
- `enabled` flag filters correctly from public endpoint
- Gradient colors (`color1`, `color2`) stored and served correctly

**Promotions:**
- CRUD complete with date-range filtering (`startsAt`, `endsAt`)
- `enabled` flag works

**Sections:**
- Upsert by key works (`PUT /home-cms/sections/:key`)
- Sections persist and returned by public endpoint

### ✅ Flutter Integration Confirmed

- Customer app fetches `/home-cms/public` on home screen load
- CMS banners override static fallback banners when present
- Banners render with correct gradient colors
- Slider dot indicator count matches CMS banner count
- Live update confirmed: banner created via API appeared in app on next launch

### ⚠️ Minor Note: Admin Login Payload

The admin login schema requires `identifier` (not `phone`) as the key:
```json
{ "identifier": "admin", "password": "<REDACTED — use ADMIN_PASSWORD env var>" }
```
Previous test used `{ "phone": ..., "password": ... }` which caused timeouts.

## Admin Dashboard

**URL:** https://wenzla-backend-production.up.railway.app/dashboard  
**CMS Tab:** Accessible via "🏠 Home CMS" nav item  
**Tab ID:** `home_cms`  
**Permissions:** `tabPerms.home_cms = null` (all admins can access)

**Dashboard CMS Features:**
- Banners tab: create, edit, enable/disable, delete, image upload
- Promotions tab: create, edit, schedule, enable/disable, delete, image upload

## Verdict: ✅ PASS — Home CMS fully operational end-to-end

- Backend: all CRUD endpoints deployed and working
- Admin dashboard: CMS tab functional
- Customer app: live banner rendering verified on real device
- No regressions in checkout, orders, authentication, or store loading
